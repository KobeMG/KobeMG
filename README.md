## Objective
A dedicated and motivated software developer with experience in a variety of technologies, seeking opportunities to work on projects that challenge and inspire me to constantly improve.

## Recent Projects
- WASA.APP: As a full-stack engineer on WASA.APP, I helped build several features of this platform that allows you to manage online stores (inventory control and sales management) through your website or the WhatsApp api. One of the key features I built was the integration of a web chat, which allowed users to communicate with their customers directly from the platform. This feature was implemented using Node JS and Firebase and has greatly improved the user experience. Other technologies used in this project include Ruby on Rails, Next Js, and React. The successful implementation of this project has resulted in creating great added value for the project.
