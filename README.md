- WASA.APP: As a full-stack engineer on WASA.APP, I helped build several features of this platform that allows you to manage online stores (inventory control and sales management) through your website or the WhatsApp api. One of the key features I built was the integration of a web chat, which allowed users to communicate with their customers directly from the platform.

The successful implementation of this project has resulted in creating great added value for the project.
